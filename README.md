# EmulsionGen

1. Encode emulsion recipes, print ("toString") these.
2. Run analysis on emulsion recipes, guess properties.
   
   Output numerical features during different steps
3. Autogen recipes
   
   Use heuristics to check correctness. Guess missing steps. Use desired properties for assistive creation.
