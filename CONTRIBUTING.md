# Contributing

email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Pull Request Process

Pull requests are the formal gatekeeping process to ensure consistent implementation of coding standards have been implemented in each change-set prior to introduction into the master branch.   Pushing local changes to the origin/master branch will be rejected.   

* Create a descriptive title for the pull request.   Mention the issue numbers addressed by the pull request in the pull request title.   Pull requests without associated issues will be summarily discarded.
* Create a description that clearly describes all the changes that were made as part of the change-set, and how they relate to the issue(s) being addressed.   All changes should be necessary for one or more of the issues being addressed.
* Ensure that you have unit-tests that strongly evidence the correctness of your code.  Be careful to consider corner cases in floating point data.
* Ensure that all your code is sufficiently commented.   All top level functions should include a haddock comment describing their use, and (if applicable) correctness conditions.   It is strongly encouraged that contributors also comment details of any algorithms, and include links to references where appropriate.   
* Your pull request must be reviewed by at least one other contributor.
* You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of the project owner, and you have attached to the issue evidence and that the software builds and tests pass.
